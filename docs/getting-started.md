## Major features

- **Fast**ï¼šUse the `pipeline` pipeline to process videos, in ideal conditions, the recording and live broadcast differ by half an hour, and the recording can beä¸Šçº¿å½•æ’­ï¼Œ**Currently the fastest version of Bilibili recording**!
- **( ðŸŽ‰ NEW)Multi-architecture**ï¼šCompatible with amd64 and arm64 architectures!
- **Multiple rooms**ï¼šSimultaneously record the content of multiple live broadcast rooms and danmaku files (including normal danmaku, paid danmaku, and gift-up-ship information).
- **Small memory usage**ï¼šAutomatically delete locally uploaded videos, saving space.
- **Template**ï¼šNo complex configuration, ready to use, automatically fetch related popular tags through the Bilibili search suggestion interface.
- **Detect and merge segments**ï¼šFor video stream segments caused by network issues or live broadcast connection issues, it can automatically detect and merge them into complete videos.
- **Automatically render danmaku**ï¼šAutomatically convert xml to ass danmaku file, the danmaku conversion tool library has been open source [DanmakuConvert](https://github.com/timerring/DanmakuConvert) and rendered to the video to form **danmaku version video** and automatically upload.
- **Low hardware requirements**ï¼šNo GPU required, only the most basic single-core CPU and the lowest memory can complete the recording, danmaku rendering, upload, etc. All processes, no minimum configuration requirements, 10-year-old computers or servers can still be used!
- **( :tada: NEW)Automatically render subtitles**ï¼šUse the OpenAI open source model `whisper`, automatically identify the speech in the video and convert it to subtitles, and render it to the video.
- **( :tada: NEW)Auto-slice upload**ï¼šCalculate the danmaku density and find the high-energy fragments, the auto-slice tool library has been open source [auto-slice-video](https://github.com/timerring/auto-slice-video), combine the multi-modal video understanding large model to automatically generate interesting slice titles and content, and automatically upload, currently supported models:
  - `GLM-4V-PLUS`
  - `Gemini-2.0-flash`
  - `Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct`
  - `SenseNova V6 Pro`
- **( :tada: NEW)Persistent login/download/upload video (supports multi-part posting)**ï¼š[bilitool](https://github.com/timerring/bilitool) has been open source, implements persistent login, download video and danmaku (including multi-part)/upload video (can post multi-part), query posting status, query detailed information, etc., one-click pip installation, can be operated using the command line cli, and can also be used as an api call.
- **( :tada: NEW)Auto-loop multi-platform live streaming**ï¼šThe tool has been open source [looplive](https://github.com/timerring/looplive) is a 7 x 24 hours fully automatic **loop multi-platform live streaming** tool.
- **( :tada: NEW)Generate style-transformed video covers**ï¼šUse the image-to-image multi-modal model to automatically obtain the video screenshot and upload the style-transformed video cover.
  - `Minimax image-01`
  - `Kwai Kolors`
  - `Tencent Hunyuan`
  - `Baidu ERNIE irag-1.0`
  - `Stable Diffusion 3.5 large turbo`
  - `Luma Photon`
  - `Ideogram V_2`
  - `Recraft`
  - `Amazon Titan Image Generator V2`
  - `Hidream I1`
  - `kling-v1-5`
